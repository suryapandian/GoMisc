bool

string

int  int8  int16  int32  int64
uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

byte // alias for uint8

rune // alias for int32
     // represents a Unicode code point

float32 float64

complex64 complex128

The zero value is:

0 for numeric types,
false for the boolean type, and
"" (the empty string) for strings.


Type casting:

var i int = 42
var f float64 = float64(i)
var u uint = uint(f)



i := 42
f := float64(i)
u := uint(f)

Printing

The verbs:

General:

%v	the value in a default format
	when printing structs, the plus flag (%+v) adds field names
%#v	a Go-syntax representation of the value
%T	a Go-syntax representation of the type of the value
%%	a literal percent sign; consumes no value
Boolean:

%t	the word true or false
Integer:

%b	base 2
%c	the character represented by the corresponding Unicode code point
%d	base 10
%o	base 8
%O	base 8 with 0o prefix
%q	a single-quoted character literal safely escaped with Go syntax.
%x	base 16, with lower-case letters for a-f
%X	base 16, with upper-case letters for A-F
%U	Unicode format: U+1234; same as "U+%04X"
Floating-point and complex constituents:

%b	decimalless scientific notation with exponent a power of two,
	in the manner of strconv.FormatFloat with the 'b' format,
	e.g. -123456p-78
%e	scientific notation, e.g. -1.234456e+78
%E	scientific notation, e.g. -1.234456E+78
%f	decimal point but no exponent, e.g. 123.456
%F	synonym for %f
%g	%e for large exponents, %f otherwise. Precision is discussed below.
%G	%E for large exponents, %F otherwise
%x	hexadecimal notation (with decimal power of two exponent), e.g. -0x1.23abcp+20
%X	upper-case hexadecimal notation, e.g. -0X1.23ABCP+20
String and slice of bytes (treated equivalently with these verbs):

%s	the uninterpreted bytes of the string or slice
%q	a double-quoted string safely escaped with Go syntax
%x	base 16, lower-case, two characters per byte
%X	base 16, upper-case, two characters per byte
Slice:

%p	address of 0th element in base 16 notation, with leading 0x
Pointer:

%p	base 16 notation, with leading 0x
The %b, %d, %o, %x and %X verbs also work with pointers,
formatting the value exactly as if it were an integer.
