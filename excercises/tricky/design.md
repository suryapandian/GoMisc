### Design App
MUSIC is an application that has a huge collection of songs.
— Songs are classified based on genre, artists, albums
— There are users who can log in to the system to listen to the songs
— Each user can create his own playlist from the list of songs. Users can create more than one playlist. User can add or remove songs from their playlist
— One user can recommend a particular song/an album/an artist/a genre to another user
— Each user can rate any song
— User should be able to search a song by name/genre/artist/title
— The system should be able to auto-suggest songs to a user based on the songs that are present in their playlist. Can match to a genre/album/artist
— The system should also be able to group songs and form playlists on its own based on any condition
